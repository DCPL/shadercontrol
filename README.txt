PLEASE READ THIS FILE THOROUGHLY BEFORE USING THE PROGRAM.

+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Thank you for downloading and using my shader control program.                    |
| Please report any current bugs here: https://github.com/dcpl/shadercontrol/issues |
+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Requirements:

1:  .NET Framework (4.5+ recommended, untested on anything older)
2:  d3d9 library (for now, tested on version 0.13, and only on d3d9 nothing newer yet)
3:  Shader-fx file or source (if you don't know what this is then you shouldn't be using this program)

How to use:

1:  Make sure all required files are in the game directory along with this program.
2:  It's recommended you run the program before launching the game.
3:  Change effects accordingly and you should be all set.
4:  It's recommended you close the game before the program as well.

FAQ:

Q:  When I change the effects or values nothing happens in-game
A:  Make sure all required files are in the same directory.
    - Depending on your file-system, you may need to run the program as an Administrator.
    - Check shader versions and directX versions make sure they match whats required.
    - Make sure the Mastereffect file has NOT been renamed.

Q:  The shader is throwing errors on values or equations
A:  All of the inputs should be error protected but if it does occur make sure you're inputting a valid value.
    - Check the line the error throws and go check it on your shader file.

Q:  Certain buttons freeze the program for a few seconds
A:  This is intentional, the shaders can't be updated quickly this is to prevent it from crashing.

Q:  Not every effect is avalible in the control.
A:  I am working on adding them as I go, this is very beta as of now only popular options are here.
